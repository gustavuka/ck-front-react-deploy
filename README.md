## FRONTEND:

The frontend is rendered with react and the project was created using Create React App.

I have used bootstrap4 to create the Navbar and the visuals, it is a responsive layout,
meaning that it will adapt to different screen sizes. The news are being injected using
react/js functionalities.

The website is fetching data from the api created in this project using Django.

The frontend has been deployed to:
https://youthful-goldstine-fe07f6.netlify.com

The node.js version used in this project is v10.16.0
